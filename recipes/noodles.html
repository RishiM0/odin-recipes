    <h1> Simple Noodles Recipe </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Any kind of noodles</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>    
        <li>Scallions/Green Onions</li>
        <li>Stir-fry sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook the noodles according to package directions. Once the noodles are cooked, 
            heat the oil in a large skillet then add the garlic and scallions and 
            cook for 1-2 minutes until browned. Then add in the noodles
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the stir-fry sauce to the pan and toss everything together on medium-high heat 
            until the noodles are evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can optionally serve these noodles with some sesame seeds and chilli flakes on 
            top which is delicious. You can also serve this with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese, 
            (for a vegetarian version) which may sound odd but trust me, is delicious!
